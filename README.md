## UX Design

### The Psychology of Colors in the Project

Our color palette was carefully selected to visually convey the project‚Äôs mission: to offer a haven of peace and clarity. Each shade plays a key role in creating a reading experience that is both focused and spiritually uplifting.

![Color Palette](assets/images/documentation/screenshots/colorpalette/colorspalette.png)

- ** Dark Tones (#222 and #333): Represent the solidity and timelessness of the message. They ensure that the text remains the central focus, providing comfortable, distraction-free reading while conveying authority and trust.

- ** Light Blue (lightblue): Our touch of serenity and hope. This color evokes a sense of calm and confidence, used strategically to illuminate the interface and guide the user intuitively and peacefully.

- ** Background (#f8feff): The foundation is a white with a subtle bluish tint, creating a clean, open, and minimalist space. It‚Äôs not just a background, but a blank canvas symbolizing the mental clarity and peace needed for reflection.
This palette was chosen to keep the site visually peaceful, clean, and uplifting.

### Typography: A Balance of Personality and Clarity

The typographic strategy was designed to be warm and engaging, balancing a personal, handwritten font with a clean, modern sans-serif for optimal readability. This pairing creates a clear hierarchy and guides the user through a friendly and accessible experience.

- **Heading Font (Gloria Hallelujah):** *The Personal Touch.* Used for main titles to create a human and friendly connection. Its handwritten style brings warmth and an inviting personality to the forefront.

- **Body Font (Quicksand):** *The Foundation of Clarity.* Chosen for all body text, menus, and buttons to ensure a comfortable and highly readable experience on any device. Its clean, modern aesthetic complements the heading font without competing for attention.

- **Accent Font (Leckerli One):** *The Elegant Signature.* Reserved for key brand elements like the logo or special call-to-actions. It adds a touch of sophistication and reinforces a unique, memorable brand identity.  
 

### Wireframes & User Flow

To ensure an intuitive and serene user experience, a series of wireframes were designed to map out the core user journey. The focus was on creating a minimalist layout that guides the user gently, eliminating distractions and focusing on the main purpose of the application.

#### Step 1: The Home Page (Desktop)

The main goal of the home page is to welcome the user in a calm and focused environment, immediately presenting the central purpose of the site.

![Wireframe - Home Page Desktop](assets/images/documentation/wireframes-desktop/wireframe1.png)

The layout is intentionally simple and centered around three key interactions:

1.  **Main Call-to-Action (CTA):** The user's journey is initiated by a single, clear call-to-action ("How are you feeling today?"). This is the primary path.
2.  **Secondary Navigation:** Essential but non-critical options ("Today's Prayer" and "Prayer Request") are placed at the corners to be accessible but not distracting.
3.  **Alternative Path:** A secondary, less prominent link ("Or get a random verse") offers a direct alternative for users who don't wish to follow the main flow.

This initial screen is designed to be a peaceful entry point, leading the user seamlessly to the next step: selecting their feeling to receive a tailored verse.

### Step 2: The Daily Prayer Popup
This flow is triggered when the user clicks on the "Today's Prayer" navigation button from the main screen. The goal is to present the prayer in a focused, immersive environment without navigating away from the home page.

![Wireframe - Home Page Today's Prayer pop-up](assets/images/documentation/wireframes-desktop/wireframe2.png)


The decision to use a popup modal is strategic. It creates a focused environment by using a blurred overlay to remove all other distractions, allowing the user to concentrate solely on the prayer. This approach also preserves the user's context, as they can easily return to the main interface without losing their place.

The popup's layout is structured for simplicity and function:

Clear Title: Immediately identifies the purpose of the popup.

Content Block: A well-defined and readable text area for the prayer.

Action Buttons: Two buttons with distinct purposes:

Primary Action ("Mark as Read"): Provides a sense of completion for the user.

Secondary Action ("Close"): Offers a simple and universal way to dismiss the modal.

This interaction provides a moment of reflection before the user seamlessly returns to the main flow.

### Step 3: The Prayer Request Popup
This flow is initiated when the user clicks on the "Prayer Request" navigation button. The goal is to provide a simple, private, and accessible way for users to submit a prayer request without disrupting their main experience.

![Wireframe - Home Page Request a Prayer pop-up](assets/images/documentation/wireframes-desktop/wireframe3.png)

Using a popup modal for this feature is a deliberate choice. It provides a focused and distraction-free interface for form submission, ensuring user privacy and concentration. Once the interaction is complete, the user is returned seamlessly to the home page.

The form's layout is designed for clarity and ease of use:

1. Clear Title: The title "Prayer Request" immediately clarifies the purpose of the modal.

2. Minimalist Form: Two straightforward input fields ("Your name" and "Write your prayer request...") make the submission process quick and intuitive.

3. Distinct Actions: The buttons are clearly defined:

Primary Action ("Send"): The main goal of the form, visually emphasized.

Secondary Action ("Close"): Allows the user to easily cancel the action without any friction.

This feature is designed to foster a sense of community and support in a seamless and respectful manner.

#### Mobile Wireframes
For mobile devices, the design was adapted to a single-column layout to ensure a clean, focused, and user-friendly experience on smaller screens. The priority is to maintain the same serene atmosphere while making all interactions easily accessible with one hand.

### Step 4: The Home Page (Mobile)
The mobile home page retains the core functionality of the desktop version but stacks the elements vertically for a natural and intuitive flow.

![Wireframe - Home Page Mobile](assets/images/documentation/wireframes-mobile/wireframe4.png)


Key adaptations for the mobile layout include:

1. Optimized Navigation: The two main navigation buttons ("Today's Prayer" and "Prayer Request") are positioned at the top of the screen, providing immediate access without cluttering the primary interaction area.

2. Prominent CTA: The main call-to-action remains the central focus, enlarged to be easily tappable and immediately draw the user's attention.

3. Vertical Hierarchy: All elements are arranged in a clear vertical hierarchy, guiding the user's eye downwards from the navigation options to the primary and secondary actions, ensuring a seamless experience.

This approach ensures that the application is just as powerful and easy to use on a mobile device as it is on a desktop.

### Step 5 - The Daily Prayer Pop-up
 
 Mobile - Daily Prayer Popup
This wireframe details the interaction of the Daily Prayer popup on mobile devices. The experience has been optimized to maintain the user's full focus by adapting the modal's design for vertical screens and touch-based interactions.

![Wireframe - Daily Prayer Pop-up Mobile](assets/images/documentation/wireframes-mobile/wireframe5.png)


Key optimizations for the mobile popup experience include:

1. Focused Overlay: The popup uses an overlay that darkens the background, eliminating distractions and centering the user's attention exclusively on the prayer's content‚Äîan even more critical approach on smaller screens.

2. Readable and Tappable Layout: The content is presented in an easy-to-read text block, and the action buttons are large and well-spaced to ensure that the interaction is simple and accessible by touch.

3. Clear Action Hierarchy: The two actions ("Mark as Read" and "Close") maintain a clear visual hierarchy, with the primary action having more emphasis to intuitively guide the user to complete or dismiss the interaction.

### Step 6 - The Prayer Request Pop-up

This wireframe details the "Prayer Request" form on mobile devices. The primary goal is to ensure the process of submitting a request is simple, private, and effortless, adapting the form's layout for a seamless touch-based experience.

![Wireframe - Prayer Request Pop-up Mobile](assets/images/documentation/wireframes-mobile/wireframe6.png)

The mobile adaptation focuses on clarity and ease of use:

1. Distraction-Free Form: The modal overlay provides a private and focused environment, allowing the user to write their request without any distractions from the main page.

2. Optimized for Touch: The input fields and text area are large and have ample spacing, making them easy to tap and type on a mobile screen.

3. Clear and Simple Actions: The `"Send" and "Close" buttons are designed to be easily accessible, with a clear visual hierarchy that guides the user toward the primary action of submitting the form.
