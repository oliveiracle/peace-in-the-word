## UX Design

### The Psychology of Colors in the Project

Our color palette was carefully selected to visually convey the project‚Äôs mission: to offer a haven of peace and clarity. Each shade plays a key role in creating a reading experience that is both focused and spiritually uplifting.

![Color Palette](assets/images/documentation/screenshots/colorpalette/colorspalette.png)

- ** Dark Tones (#222 and #333): Represent the solidity and timelessness of the message. They ensure that the text remains the central focus, providing comfortable, distraction-free reading while conveying authority and trust.

- ** Light Blue (lightblue): Our touch of serenity and hope. This color evokes a sense of calm and confidence, used strategically to illuminate the interface and guide the user intuitively and peacefully.

- ** Background (#f8feff): The foundation is a white with a subtle bluish tint, creating a clean, open, and minimalist space. It‚Äôs not just a background, but a blank canvas symbolizing the mental clarity and peace needed for reflection.
This palette was chosen to keep the site visually peaceful, clean, and uplifting.

### Typography
To create a warm and uplifting user experience, three different fonts were chosen:

- **Gloria Hallelujah** ‚Äì Used for the main titles and headings, giving a friendly, handwritten and personal touch.  
- **Quicksand** ‚Äì Used for body text, menus, and buttons, ensuring readability and a modern, clean look across all devices.  
- **Leckerli One** ‚Äì Used for special highlights such as the site logo or call-to-action elements, adding elegance and a unique identity to the brand.  
 

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created for both desktop and mobile to plan the layout and user flow before building the site.
