## UX Design

### Colour Palette
The website uses a **soft and calm color palette** to reflect serenity and hope. The tones are minimalist, ensuring that the focus remains on the Word of God.

- **Primary (Text / Titles):** `#222` (soft black)  
- **Secondary (Body Text):** `#444` (dark gray)  
- **Accent (Highlights / Button borders):** `#add8e6` (light blue)  
- **Background:** `#f8feff` (white with a soft blue hue)  
- **Border / Special Highlight:** `#eee5da` (light beige, used in the central button)  
- **Button Background:** `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)` (translucent white)  
- **Popup Overlay:** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)` (semi-transparent dark background)

This palette was chosen to keep the site visually peaceful, clean, and uplifting.

### Typography
To create a warm and uplifting user experience, three different fonts were chosen:

- **Gloria Hallelujah** ‚Äì Used for the main titles and headings, giving a friendly, handwritten and personal touch.  
- **Quicksand** ‚Äì Used for body text, menus, and buttons, ensuring readability and a modern, clean look across all devices.  
- **Leckerli One** ‚Äì Used for special highlights such as the site logo or call-to-action elements, adding elegance and a unique identity to the brand.  
 

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created for both desktop and mobile to plan the layout and user flow before building the site.
